1. Research and write what is the use of sealed class.
WACP to illustrate sealed class.


2. Research and write what is the difference
between normal properties and auto-implemented
properties.
WACP to illustrate normal properties
WACP to issustrate auto-implemented properties

3. Research and fix the below issue:

interface IRules
    {
        int Age { get; set; }

        int add(int a, int b);

        public void PrintHi()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hi");
        }
    }

4. WACP to check if the number is prime or not
using logic discussed in the class
HINT : use break;

5. print numbers from 1 to 30
   and skip the numbers divisible by 3
HINT : use continue;

6. Find the first number after 1000 which is
divisible by 97.
HINT : use for loop and break
